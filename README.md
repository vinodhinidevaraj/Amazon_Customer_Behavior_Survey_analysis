**Project Overview**

In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Amazon Customer Behavior Survey dataset to gain insights into customer behaviour and satisfaction. We began by loading the dataset and examining the data types of the columns to ensure consistency and accuracy in our analysis. Statistical analysis was performed on numerical columns to understand their distribution and characteristics. Normality tests were conducted to assess whether the data followed a normal distribution, and histograms were plotted to visualize the distribution.

 **Data Overview** 
 The dataset used for this analysis contains responses from the Amazon Customer Behaviour Survey. It includes information on various factors such as product search methods, review reliability, recommendation helpfulness, rating accuracy, shopping satisfaction, service appreciation, and improvement areas.

**Data Preparation**
Relevant columns were selected from the dataset for analysis. Missing or invalid data were handled by dropping rows with any missing values. A new column called “age_group” has been created to categorize the respondents' ages into groups for a better understanding of the survey data.


**Correlation Analysis**

Anderson correlation analysis was performed using a heatmap to identify correlations between different variables. Specifically, we examined the relationship between 'Rating Accuracy' and 'Shopping Satisfaction' using a linear regression model, aiming to understand the impact of rating accuracy on customer satisfaction.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

We explored various aspects of customer behaviour and satisfaction through EDA. Analysis was conducted on factors such as 'Purchase Frequency,' 'Purchase Categories,' 'Customer Reviews Importance,' 'Personalized Recommendation Frequency,' 'Service Appreciation,' and 'Improvement Areas.' Histograms, bar plots, and grouped bar plots were used to visualize and analyze the data, providing valuable insights into customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and areas for improvement.

**Gender Analysis**

A gender analysis was conducted to compare 'Purchase Frequency' between different genders. Normality tests revealed significant differences in purchase frequency between genders. Further exploration included histograms for age distribution and bar plots for gender distribution.

**Conclusion**

Overall, our analysis provided comprehensive insights into Amazon customer behaviour and satisfaction. By leveraging statistical techniques and data visualization, we uncovered patterns, correlations, and key factors influencing customer satisfaction. This information can be valuable for Amazon in refining its services, enhancing customer experience, and driving business growth.
